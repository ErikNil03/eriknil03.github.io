# eriknil03.github.io

Made in 2022 inspired by HTML5UP design: https://html5up.net/

This is a personal website, where I will be displaying different kind of content.
Some examples are work experience and personal projects that I work on.

This is a part of my process of learning HTML, CSS and JS.

Check out the website for yourself @ https://eriknilsson.dev/#
